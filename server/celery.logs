You are using `-A` as an option of the worker sub-command:
celery worker -A celeryapp <...>

The support for this usage was removed in Celery 5.0. Instead you should use `-A` as a global option:
celery -A celeryapp worker <...>
Usage: celery worker [OPTIONS]
Try 'celery worker --help' for help.

Error: No such option: -A
